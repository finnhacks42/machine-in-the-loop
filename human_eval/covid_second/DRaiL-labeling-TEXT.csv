There‚Äôs no doubt the politicization of the COVID vaccine has lead to a lot of this - this has turned into a left and right stance. There is overwhelming evidence the vaccine is both safe and effective, what makes this vaccine any different from say Polio or MMR vaccines?;ProVaxersSpreadMissinfo;1
@blazebabe42069 The vaccine doesn't prevent you from contracting COVID. It reduces the amount of time it takes for your body to cure it. If people didn't keep spreading it we wouldn't have to test the race between body healing and virus multiplying.;VaxLessensSymptoms;1
